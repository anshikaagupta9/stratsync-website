# StratSync Pilot AI

This is a redesigned version of the StratSync Pilot AI site for the internship assessment.

The original site had a basic layout but lacked brand-specific identity and interactivity. The colors did not reflect the gradient logo, and spacing and visual hierarchy were minimal. The call-to-action buttons lacked prominence.

- Added gradient animation to the hero background.
- Responsive layout for mobile screens.
- Feature card hover effects for interactivity.
- SEO meta tags for professional polish.
